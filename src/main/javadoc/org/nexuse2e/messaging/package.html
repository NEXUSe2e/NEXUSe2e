<p>The central concept in the processing of messages in the NEXUSe2e
system is that of a pipeline: a <code>Pipeline</code> is a processing
chain that can contain a virtually unlimited number of processing
components, the so called <code>Pipelet</code>. Each Pipelet performs a
well defined operation on the message flowing through the system, e.g.
compiling message header information, handling compression of data etc.</p>
<p>The overall system is segmented into the fronent and backend. The
frontend is responsible for implementing the transport, routing and
packaging of messages. The backend handles any kind of data creation,
conversion or consumption of message payloads.</p>
<p>The processing of messages is distinguishes between inbound and
outbound message processing. Consequently there are different pipelines
operating on inbound and outbound messages.</p>
